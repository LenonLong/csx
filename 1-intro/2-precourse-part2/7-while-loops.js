/*
Challenge: While Loops - Fundamentals
A while loop is an alternative iteration statement. JavaScript's thread of execution will repeatedly process the code block until the 
while loop's conditional expression evaluates to false. **Be careful to avoid an infinite loop!**

Challenge:
Use a while loop to increment count by 2 on each repetition of the block of code. Run the code block of your while loop until count is 8.
*/

let count = 2;
// ADD CODE HERE
while (count < 8) {
    console.log(count)
    count++;
}

// Uncomment these to check your work!
console.log(count);
