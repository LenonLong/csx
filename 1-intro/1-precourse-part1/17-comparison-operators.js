Challenge: Booleans: Comparison Operators

In programming, when working with data, we often need to compare different values. To do this, we use a series of operators called comparison operators. 
Check out this list of the most common comparison operators:

< - Less than
> - Greater than
<= - Less than or equal to
>= - Greater than or equal to
== - Is loosely equal to
=== - Is strictly equal to
!= - Is not loosely equal to
!== - Is not strictly equal to
The first four are probably pretty familiar to you from primary school math class, but things start to get a little tricky when we talk about equality in JavaScript.

First, we already know that a single equals sign (=) is used to assign value to a variable, so we can't use that to compare to values unfortunately.
So let's start with loose equality (==). This operator is used to compare if 2 values have the same value, even if they aren't necessarily the same type.

 1   ==  1        // true
"1"  ==  1        // true
 1   == '1'       // true

true == true      // true
false == false    // true
In the example above, all of these comparisons are true, because the value is the same even though they may have a different data type.

For 2 values to be strictly equal (===) to each other, they need to not only have the same value, but also must have the same data type:

 2   ===  2        // true
"2"  ===  2        // false
 2   === '2'       // false

true === true      // true
false === false    // true
Don't worry if this still seems a little confusing. We'll come back to it a bit more when we get to conditional statements in the second half of the precourse.

Challenge:
For the following problems, you will be using the comparison operators (==, ===, <, >, <=, >=) to compare two variables 
iand see if the comparison yields true or false. You will assign the resulting boolean to a variable. For example:

let first = 7;
let second = 8;

let isFirstBigger = first > second;
console.log(isFirstBigger); // should log: false

first = 16;
isFirstBigger = first > second;
console.log(isFirstBigger); // should log: true
1. Compare small and large using the < operator. Assign the result to a variable called isSmaller.

2. Compare num and string. First, use the == operator to compare the two variables, and assign the result to a variable calledisLooselyEqual. 
Second, use the === operator to compare the variables; assign the result to a variable called isStrictlyEqual.

3. Compare isTrue and isFalse using the !== operator. Assign the result to a variable called isTrueNotFalse.
Continue to experiment with different comparison operators and data types. You can see a full list of comparison operators here

// 1.
const small = 2;
const large = 5342;
// ADD CODE BELOW (isSmaller)
let isSmaller = small < large;

// 2.
const num = 45;
const string = "45";
// ADD CODE BELOW (isLooselyEqual and isStrictlyEqual)
let isLooselyEqual = num == string
let isStrictlyEqual = num === string;
// 3.
const isTrue = true;
const isFalse = false;
// ADD CODE BELOW (isTrueNotFalse)
let isTrueNotFalse = isTrue !== isFalse

// Uncomment these to check your work! 
console.log('Is 2 < 5342?'); 
console.log(isSmaller);
console.log('Is 45 loosely equal to "45"?'); 
console.log(isLooselyEqual);
console.log('Is 45 strictly equal to "45"?');
console.log(isStrictlyEqual);
console.log('Is true not equal to false?'); 
console.log(isTrueNotFalse);
