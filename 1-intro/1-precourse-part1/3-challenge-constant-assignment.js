Challenge: Constant Assignment - (const)

Ok, so now that you have a hang of var and let, let's practice declaring a constant. As we metioned in the previous lesson, 
sometimes we want a variable who's value never changes. In this case we use the const keyword. For instance, take a look at the example below. 
My favorite TV show is Game of Thrones, and obviously that's never going to change, so I've declared a constant myFavoriteShow 
and assigned it a value of "Game of Thrones".

const myFavoriteShow = "Game of Thrones";
console.log(myFavoriteShow) // => "Game of Thrones"
Maybe your favorite tv show changes quite often though, so here's a few more concrete examples of variables that won't ever change:
*/
// Declare a constant myCodingConfidence and assign it a value of "unwavering"
const myCodingConfidence = 'unwavering';

// Try un-commenting the line below to test your answer
console.log("My confidence in my coding ability is " + myCodingConfidence);
