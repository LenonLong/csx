Challenge: typeof Operator
Quite often in programming, we need to be able to look up what the specific data type of a given operand is. In JavaScript, 
the typeof operator returns the data type of its operand in the form of a string. Operand can be any object, function or variable.

typeof("testing")   // => "string"
typeof(22)         // => "number"
typeof(false)      // => "boolean"
Keep in mind that the typeof an array is an object.

Challenge
1. Declare a variable favMovieType. Then, using the typeof operator, assign it the value of favMovie's data type.

2. Declare a variable timesSeenType. Then, using the typeof operator, assign it the value of timesSeen's data type.

3. Declare a variable seeAgainType. Then, using the typeof operator, assign it the value of goingToWatchItAgain's data type
*/

const favMovie = "Star Wars: Episod IV";
const timesSeen = 732;
const goingToWatchItAgain = true; 

// ADD CODE BELOW HERE
const favMovieType = typeof(favMovie)               // => string
const timesSeenType = typeof(timesSeen)             // => number
const seeAgainType = typeof(goingToWatchItAgain)    // => true
